# Prebuilt binary packages

If you are lucky, you won't have to build it. Many Linux and BSD systems have pre-built OpenSCAD packages including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Check your system's package manager for details.

## generic linux binary package
There is also a generic linux binary package at http://www.openscad.org that can be unpacked and run from within most linux systems. It is self contained and includes the required libraries.

## nightly builds
see https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:t-paul/OpenSCAD

## chrysn's Ubuntu packages
For Ubuntu systems you can also try [chrysn's Ubuntu packages](https://launchpad.net/~chrysn/+archive/openscad) at his launchpad PPA, or run:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chrysn/openscad
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install openscad
