# Types of tests:
# o echo: Just record console output
# o dump: Export .csg
# o render-cgal: Export to PNG using --render
# o render-force-cgal: Export to PNG using --render=force
# o render-manifold: Export to PNG using --render with --backend=manifold
# o render-force-manifold: Export to PNG using --render=force with --backend=manifold
# o preview-cgal: Export to PNG using OpenCSG
# o preview-manifold: Export to PNG in preview mode with --backend=manifold
# o throwntogether-cgal: Export to PNG using the Throwntogether renderer
# o throwntogether-manifold
# o render-csg-cgal: 1) Export to .csg, 2) import .csg and export to PNG (--render)
# o render-monotone: Same as render-cgal but with the "Monotone" color scheme
# o preview-stl: Export to STL, Re-import and render to PNG (--render)
# o render-stl: Export to STL, Re-import and render to PNG (--render=force)

# There are some caveats with export and import, so we need to test a few combinations:
# 1. It may be possible to export a non-manifold mesh (e.g. malformed polyhedron) due to 
#    no manifoldness checks at export time. This is by design, e.g. to allow users to 
#    troubleshoot externally.
# 2. It may be possible to import such non-manifolds and preview or render them, but it will
#    likely fail when trying to construct a data structure requiring manifold objects (e.g. --render=force)
#
# This leads to three types of tests:
# 1. <format>render: Manifold object export + render (both with --render=force)
# 2. <format>preview: Non-manifold polyhedron export + preview
# 3. <format>render: Complex Manifold polyhedron export + render (both with --render=force)
#    e.g. self-touching polyhedron or malformed but repairable.
